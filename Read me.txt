This folder includes three Python scripts and a dataset used for model development and comparison.

1. Database File
The Excel file contains two identical sheets, each providing the dataset used for model development.

The dataset includes input features and target values for training and evaluation.

2. Model Training Scripts
Each script trains a predictive model and outputs a .pkl file containing the saved model.

Comparison between ML models-gypsum Tind.py
Compares the performance of different machine learning algorithms—including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting—over 100 random states.

Smoluchowski model-gypsum Tind.py
Implements a mechanistic model based on the Smoluchowski aggregation theory. The dataset is fitted to this model to extract interfacial energy values.

Integrated machine learning and Smoluchowski model-gypsum Tind.py
Integrates the machine learning models with domain knowledge from the Smoluchowski model. It uses the same input features as the comparison script, with additional feature derived from the Smoluchowski model ( interfacial energy).
